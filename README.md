keeptempo-mwiki-ext
===================

A sort of extension for mediawiki to display info from Zetetic's keeptempo.com service. But Zetetic sucks and killed the service abruptly without offering any continuation option to the best of my knowledge.

There are three needed include files: cred.inc, ppl.inc, projects.inc
